                                    We are subject to individual Countries laws. Therefore, be sure what you are ordering is allowed

                                    It is expected of members to be honest and act professional towards the customer we expose
                                    them to. Failure to do so will amount to their expulsion from all OAB platforms, programs and
                                    privileges as the case may be without prior notification.
                                    Customers are recommended to report any inconvenience or dissatisfaction as per the services
                                    received for address and improvements. Remember, we are in this together, for a better Africa!</p>

                                    Every financial transaction between an OAB member and a customer should be effected
                                    through the organization 's bank account for the safety of both members trader and customers.<br/>

                                    customer 's confirmation of receipt & satisfaction. Should the customer remain silent on any of
                                    these two counts, OAB shall rely on the delivery notice/report by the courier in charge of the
                                    delivery and pay into members' account.OAB and its members will therefore be free of any

                                    jurisdiction.<br/>

                                    Financial transactions directly into member trader accounts are out of OAB jurisdiction.
                                    Customers are expected to check the product upon receipt for possible replacement or any
                                    other insensitive form from the trader.<br/>

                                    Replacement shall only be if product or item received do not correspond to that which was
                                    ordered for. Customers are required to report any dissatisfaction as per product quality
                                    immediately upon delivery for possible action.<br/></p>
